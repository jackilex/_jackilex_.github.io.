Bio:
My name is Alex Saint Victor, I am a Veteran with a background in Construction Management as a Project Engineer.
In the construction field, I obtained many skills such as; planning to execute, scheduling to meet deadlines,
perform quality control to make sure that the best product is delivered to the client, keep track that work performance
is in compliance per rules. I have also managed and coordinate with multiple contractors. 
The ambition to learn more, the search for a more challenging field and technical skills 
has bought me to the Technology field. After completing my extensive Web Developing Bootcamp at UT Austin, 
I couldnâ€™t be more excited for this new path with more exciting challenges and new skills to obtain and master alone the way.
